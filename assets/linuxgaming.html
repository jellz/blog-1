    <p>Backstory: I wanted to get back into "serious" Gaming, I haven't played any other games (other than <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>) 
        since I switched to Arch Linux.<br>
        So, I bought a GTX 1050 Ti, installed nVidia drivers, opened my PC and inserted the card into the slot.
        <br>I opened my terminal and installed <a href="https://lutris.net">Lutris</a> - selected Overwatch, followed the instructions, waited a while for it to download then.
        <h3>BANG</h3>
        <h4 class="inlined">It just worked</h4>. I was expecting to have to mess with it for a while to get it to work but I didn't need to.
        <br>
        That's all for now, I might update this article in the future if I learn anything new.
