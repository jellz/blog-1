# Linux Gaming ~~Adventures~~

Backstory: I wanted to get back into "serious" Gaming, I haven't played any other games (other than [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net)) since I switched to Arch Linux.  
So, I bought a GTX 1050 Ti, installed nVidia drivers, opened my PC and inserted the card into the slot.  
I opened my terminal and installed [Lutris](https://lutris.net) - selected Overwatch, followed the instructions, waited a while for it to download then.

### BANG

#### It just worked

I was expecting to have to mess with it for a while to get it to work but I didn't need to.  
That's all for now, I might update this article in the future if I learn anything new.  
  

#### Specs (Overwatch, I got smooth gameplay @ Medium 720p60):

  
CPU: Intel i5-4430  
GPU: GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1050Ti
